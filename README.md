# Web Based Bot Debugger (WBBD)

The main focus of the project is to allow debugging discord bots during runtime, it's made for ease of development.

#### [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
Since Electron uses Chromium, it allows for easy code editing and debugging through [developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

### Android (Or phone in general)
Android support was highly requested on projects like this, however, I decided it won't be a part of this one either because this project is being made purely for debugging, rather than allowing you to talk to other users as a bot.

### Info
For now this project is just a template, of how it's supposed to look like in the future!
It's designed to look similar to discord to avoid another learning curve.
